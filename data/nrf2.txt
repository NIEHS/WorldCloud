ABSTRACT 

Hyperoxia exposure of new born rodents has been served as a model for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) phenotypes found in a sub-population of premature infants. We previously demonstrated that Nrf2 modulates molecular events during saccular-to-alveolar lung maturation and also has a protective role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury, mortality, arrest of saccular-to-alveolar transition, and lung injury, using Nrf2-deficient and wild-type neonates. In this review, we describe how whole-genome transcriptome analyses can identify the means through which Nrf2 transcriptionally modulates organ injury and morphology, cellular growth/proliferation, vasculature development, and immune response during BPD-like pathogenesis. We illustrate how recently developed bioinformatics tools identify sets of Nrf2-dependently modulated genes in the BPD model to elucidate direct Nrf2 downstream targets and chemicals/drugs that may act on them. These approaches will provide significant insights into the promising therapeutic agents for Nrf2-dependent significant complication of the preterm birth like BPD.

Introduction
      Respiratory distress syndrome is a breathing disorder that affects a subpopulation of infants with preterm birth (prior to 37 weeks of completed gestation). Premature infant lungs are underdeveloped (saccular phase at 24-36 weeks of gestation) and are unable to make enough surfactant to maintain alveolar ventilation of blood oxygenation until they enter into the alveolar phase. Critical morphologic processes of the saccular phase include expansion of distal airways for subsequent alveolar formation, differentiation of type 1 and 2 pneumocytes, and thinning of the air-blood barrier. Treatments for lung prematurity include surfactant replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, oxygen, and other strategies to reduce further lung injury, provide nutrition and other support for lung growth and recovery, and prevent lung infections. If premature infants still require oxygen therapy by the time they reach normal delivery dates, they're diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although BPD has multifactorial causes, it has been recently defined as a result from aberrant development of immature lungs exposed to the ex-uterine milieu [1] because the disease is mostly concentrated in very-low-birth weight (< 1,000 g) prematurity [2]. The risk of BPD is indeed inversely proportional to the gestational age at birth [3]. Unfortunately, permanent arrest of lung growth in BPD may cause lifelong functional abnormalities [4].
      Due to lack of a safe and effective treatment, BPD remains the most significant pulmonary complication of the preterm birth. Excessive oxygen use can paradoxically increase the risk of BPD because it can lead to oxidant injury while low oxygen saturation targets may increase the likelihood of death [5]. In addition, studies with high frequency ventilation have led to potentially less invasive care strategies [6]. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been approved clinically for more than a decade while efficacy to prevent or treat BPD is controversial [7]. Moreover, the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference (https://consensus.nih.gov/2010/inofinalstatement.htm) concluded with avoidance of routine iNO use for premature infants. In addition to clinical investigations, experimental BPD models in rodents have been widely examined for pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention as neonatal rodents are normally born with premature lungs and develop pulmonary changes similar to BPD after hyperoxia exposure. More recent studies with the BPD models demonstrated novel stem cells therapeutic options The studies demonstrated that prophylactic administration of mesenchymal stromal cells before hyperoxia exposure showed marked mitigation of alveolar injury, inflammation, pulmonary hypertension, or lung compliance, while administration of these stem cells after hyperoxia exposure did not provide convincing results (see review [8]).
      In utero expression of airway antioxidant enzymes are known to increase toward term gestation to prepare for birth into an O2-rich (from 3% to 21%) environment [9]. Therefore, preterm infants with low birth weight are not only more sensitive to increased oxygen concentrations compared to adults [10], but they also have diminished/compromised endogenous antioxidant activity relative to full term infants [9], which is thought to contribute to the critical consequence of hyperoxic insult in BPD pathogenesis. While multiple studies are under investigation [11], overall clinical trials of antioxidant therapies (e.g., superoxide dismutases (SODs), vitamins A and E, N-acetylcysteine, metalloporphyrin) in management of BPD have remained inconclusive although recombinant human SOD has shown marginal efficacy (see review [12]). Nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2, like 2 (Nfe2l2) or NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an indispensable transcriptional regulator for diverse antioxidant enzyme and host defense protein genes bearing antioxidant response elements (AREs). Critical roles of Nrf2 function have been well defined in vivo using adult mice with genetically engineered Nrf2 and its cytoplasmic inhibitor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1) in acute lung injury (ALI), emphysema, allergy and asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, lung tumor, and respiratory syncytial virus disease [13]. Roles for Nrf2 in organ development and neonatal disease have also recently been identified in murine experimental BPD. Compared to wild type controls, augmented lethality, lung injury, and arrested saccular-to-alveolar transition after hyperoxia exposure were found in neonatal mice deficient in Nrf2 (Nrf2-/-) [14,15]. The surviving juvenile Nrf2-/- mice had decreased surfactant-producing type 2 cells [15], which indicated long term pulmonary outcome and the predisposition potential for oxidative pulmonary disease in adults or adolescents. Data also suggested a therapeutic potential to enhance Nrf2-mediated pulmonary responses in BPD pathogenesis. Supporting the role for Nrf2-ARE responses, increased BPD risk was associated with functional polymorphisms in NRF2 and in ARE-responsive GSTP1, NQO1, and UGT1A1 in several human cohorts [16-18]. 
      In order to further elucidate the gene transcripts affected by Nrf2 in healthy and diseased lungs we performed genome-wide lung cDNA microarray analyses. The analyses demonstrated that Nrf2-mediated protection against hyperoxia-induced ALI phentoypes may be through transcriptional regulation of genes associated with DNA replication and cell cycle, various metabolism and small molecular process, and cell-cell interaction as well as redox homeostasis in the saccular phase lungs [14,19]. We also found altered lung transcriptomes for sustaining lung morphogenesis, cell growth machinery, and lymphocyte immunity during saccular lung maturation in hyperoxia-susceptible Nrf2-/- neonates [14], suggesting their roles in predisposing the immature lung to oxidant-induced disorders. Among the key Nrf2 effectors contributing to the protection against BPD-like disorders are glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2) and macrophage receptor with collagenase structure (Marco) [14]. 
      In the current review, we revisited selected sets of our microarray data which were differentially regulated by Nrf2 basally and during hyperoxia in neonatal lungs to demonstrate the value of transcriptomics and bioinformatic approaches to identify novel gene transcripts and gene networks that contribute to normal lung development and response to ALI [14]. We elucidated direct Nrf2 downstream target genes bearing AREs by position weight matrix (PWM)-based computerized algorithmic screening [20] and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) database search for Nrf2/Maf binding [21-24]. We also determined chemicals and drugs that are predicted to perturb the mode of gene expression (high or lower in Nrf2-/- compared to Nrf2-/- at baseline or after hyperoxia) by The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) analysis. The results from these recently developed bioinformatics tools provide informative clues for more promising intervention compounds in BPD protection or treatment.  

Transcriptome data for bioinformatics analyses
      The microarray data had been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, accession number GSE29632) and in NIEHS Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS, accession number: 005-00003-0012-000-0). The previously profiled data sets were reanalyzed by newer version of GeneSpring 12.6 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), to generate gene lists for further analyses. A number of bioinformatics tools have been developed to query transcription profiles for gene networks, canonical pathways, and co-expressed genes [e.g. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen, Redwood City, CA), Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT, http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/public/html/), Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, https://david.ncifcrf.gov/), Extracting Patterns and Identifying co-expressed Genes, http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/epig/index.cfm). In order to provide the most recent updates in gene identity and networks, we focused first on Nrf2-dependently varied gene transcripts (> 2-fold at least one time point, n=396) from the saccular stage (post-natal days P1-P3, characterized by simple, poorly septated saccules) and the more mature late saccular/early alveolar phase (P4, branched septa and multilobular alveoli). While developmental gene variation was highest between P1 and P4 in wild type mice, the greatest genotype effects were found at days P2-P3. Our previous visual profile analysis also revealed distinct set of genes which were markedly overexpressed at P2-P3 of Nrf2-/- mice [14], so we used analysis by similar entities (GeneSpring, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to identify 141 correlated transcripts. Among the canonical pathways identified by IPA for this Nrf2-dependent transcript set was T cell receptor signaling, which has not been previously implicated in studies of this transcription factor. Following similar approaches, we also analyzed gene transcript expression changes induced by postnatal hyperoxia exposure (1-3 days starting from P1) and were Nrf2-dependent (p<0.01, >2-fold n=437).. Description of these Nrf2-dependently modulated neonatal lung genes and their expression profiles as well as the associated functions and molecular networks have been published previously [14].
Putative ARE search for potential Nrf2 downstream effectors.

LICNS analysis for chemical targets
      LINCS (The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures) analysis was performed on the gene signatures obtained from our microarray gene expression experiment on the Nrf2-dependently modulated neonatal lung gene sets using the L1000CDS2 search engine (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/L1000CDS2/#/index). We took gene transcripts significantly higher or lower (>2-fold) in Nrf2-/- mice compared to the same exposure condition or postnatal age, chose “reverse” mode for small molecule signatures that reversed our input, and allowed the small molecular combination [32]. For the gene sets markedly high only in KO baseline, we used the signatures and their relative expression ratio between ICR and Nrf2-KO as input for the analysis. For the top 50 search results ranked by the “search score” obtained from the L1000CDS2 analysis (when up and down lists were available) or the largest consine distance (KO baseline), we performed additional statistical tests for significance. To do so, we downloaded the original L1000 gene expression signatures computed using the characteristic direction signature method [33] for each chemical compound perturbation and the respective cell line landmark gene signatures and all ~22,000 L1000 genes. We then implemented the hypergeometric test that produced a p value for each enrichment result. All gene signatures were annotated with Entrez symbols and duplicate gene entries were filtered prior to the test. 
      We next used LINCS1000 to identify via signature overlap assessment, transcript profiles from cell-based drug perturbation experiments that overlap with transcript profiles generated for ozone exposure responses (Tables S3 and S4). At baseline, significant overlaps with perturbation-induced profiles were determined only at P4 for the Nrf2-dependent transcripts and they included anti-inflammatory (e.g., Zolantidine, Meclocycline, Fenbufen) and chemotherapeutic  (e.g., Tipifarnib)  agents (Table S3). Significantly high overlaps were also found between our differential transcript lists at all three time points. The minimum overlap ratios (the input differential transcripts and the signature differential transcripts divided by the effective input) ranged from 0.0349 to 0.0581 across the time points [32]. ………………
      Among many perturbing agents (Tables 2 and S3), L-sulforaphane and 15-delta prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) were predicted to reverse the Nrf2-dependent transcriptome changes during the BPD-like pathogenesis. These finding are consistent with the current concepts of Nrf2 regulation. 15d PGJ2 is not only an Nrf2 activator acting through Keap1 binding [34] but a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-?) which bears functional AREs for Nrf2 modulation [35]. Through NF-?B inhibition, it is known as a key regulator of inflammation [36,37]. We also demonstrated Nrf2-dependent protection of acute lung injury by 15d-PGJ2 in mice [35]. Sulforaphane is a powerful phytochemical Nrf2 agonists, and its role in anti-carcinogenesis and pulmonary protection against bacterial infection following emphysema, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and inhaled arsenic has been demonstrated in rodent studies (see review [13]). Moreover, controlled human studies recently reported the therapeutic potential of sulforaphane in reducing adverse effects of airway toxicants [38-40]. This LINCS-based approach to investigation of transcript profiles has the potential to identify other drugs or chemicals that behave similar to 15d-PGJ2 and sulphoraphane, and provide additional means to upregulate anti-oxidant and other lung cellular defense mechanisms.

Conclusions
      We here reported direct Nrf2 downstream effector genes and drugs/chemicals that may act on the Nrf2-ARE pathways for BPD prevention or treatment. Nrf2 effectors bearing AREs determined by functional bioinformatics in the upstream region as well as in the vicinity of the genes (Tables 1, S1, S2) have broad spectrum of activity including lung morphogenesis, cell growth machinery, and lymphocyte immunity….. (Figure 2)…… Our reports will add clues to the potential therapeutic strategy for the lung diseases in prematurity.
